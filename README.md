# Stock-Price-Prediction-and-Forecasting-Project


This project focuses on predicting and forecasting stock prices using machine learning and data analysis techniques. By leveraging historical stock data, the model aims to provide insights into potential future stock prices, aiding investors and traders in making informed decisions.

Key Features:
Data Collection: Utilizes historical stock price data obtained from reliable financial sources or APIs.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducts in-depth EDA to understand the patterns, trends, and potential influencing factors in the historical stock data.

Feature Engineering: Extracts relevant features and performs transformations to enhance the model's predictive power.

Machine Learning Models: Implements and evaluates various machine learning models for stock price prediction, including regression models, time series models, and ensemble methods.

Evaluation Metrics: Utilizes appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or others to assess the performance of the models.

Visualization: Presents visualizations, including time series plots, prediction vs. actual comparisons, and other relevant visual aids for better understanding.

Forecasting: Implements forecasting techniques to predict future stock prices based on the trained models.

Technologies Used:
Python: Primary programming language for data processing, analysis, and model implementation.

Libraries: Utilizes popular libraries such as pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and others for data manipulation and machine learning.

Jupyter Notebooks: Utilizes Jupyter notebooks for interactive development, allowing for clear documentation and explanation of the analysis.
